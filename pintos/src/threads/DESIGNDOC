			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----
>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct alarm {
  struct list_elem elem;
  int64_t alarm_tick;    /* Wait until this tick to wake */
  struct semaphore sem;
};

--list_elem elem is for use with the list libary.
--sem is the semaphore downed by the thread when it goes to sleep.  The
  interrupt will wake the thread by upping this semaphore.
--alarm_tick is the tick when the interrupt will up the semaphore.

struct list alarm_list;

--alarm_list contains the alarm structs, one for each sleeping
thread.  This list is sorted by alarm_tick so the next alarm is at the head.


---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

When a thread calls timer_sleep(), the thread declares a new alarm,
initializes the semaphore and sets the alarm by assigning its wake up
tick.  Then the alarm is added to the alarm_list, which is checked by the
interrupt handler.  The handler at each tick will compare the first alarm
in the list with the current tick in the check_alarms function.  If the
alarm should be woken up, then it is, the alarm is removed from the list
and the next alarm is checked. If the first alarm is not ready to be woken
up, then the handler returns. 

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

In order for the handler to run as quickly as possible, the alarm list is
sorted so that the head of the list wakes up before any alarm behind it.
This means that if no alarm fires, the function returns immediately.  At
worst, this algorithm is linear in the number of alarms that are firing at
once.

Additionally, there is no need for alarms to be allocated to the heap
because the lifetime of the alarm is the lifetime of the call to
timer_sleep().  The handler does not need to spend time on memory management.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

Because the only time when threads touch shared state is when new alarms
are added to the list, we disable interrupts while the call to
list_insert_ordered is running. Concurrent calls to timer_sleep will not
interfere while inside this critical section.   

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

We prevent timer interrupts by disabling interrupts while inserting alarms
into the alarm list.  The only interaction between timer_sleep and
timer_interrupt is in the alarm_list, so by isolating the insert, races
are avoided.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

This design was chosen because it has the simplest implementation that
functions correctly.  Because interrupts can't go to sleep, primitives
such as locks and conditions could not work.  Semaphores, however, allowed
for a thread to sleep and an interrupt to wake the thread up.

The most important implementation detail was deciding to order the
alarm_list so that checking alarms was as fast as possible.  The
additional cost of the ordered list is incurred during insertion.
calls to timer_sleep are rare compared to calls to timer_interrupt, so the
system can afford to charge the cost to the less frequent function.
timer_interrupt is called at every tick, so it had to be fast.  A previous
design had the alarms allocated to the heap and then later freed once the
thread had been woken up.  However, calls to free() take up to 2 ticks of
CPU time, meaning that ticks were lost whenever free is called.  Luckily,
allocating to the heap was unnecessary.  Although the code passed the
tests when timer_sleep did not disable interrupts, there was the potential
for race conditions, so adding the critical section was an obvious improvement.
